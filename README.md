[draw on whiteboard, use visual aids/discussion]
In computer science, control flow (or alternatively, flow of control) is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated.

Turn and Talk
	Examples of control flow you've worked through outside of programming
  
Group Discussion

  Example of why we need to be precise in our language. Computer's cannot read between the lines.
  A wife asks her husband, a computer programmer; "Could you please go to the store for me and buy one carton of milk, and if they have eggs, get 6!"
  A short time later the husband comes back with 6 cartons of milk.
  The wife asks him, "Why the hell did you buy 6 cartons of milk?"
  He replied, "They had eggs."

  Coder's are funny.

Fist to five check-in.
